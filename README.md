*Effect House*

*NOTE*

The Effect House projects provided were developed on Windows. I used Effect House on Mac before but currently I use Windows and the Win version is currently in Beta. It was a bit buggy and the performance wasn't great either but I still managed to get the effects to work.

//this or that

The demo video provided along with the assets had some differences but not any major ones which is why I played along with it and added a bit of my changes while keeping the overall theme pretty much the same. 

//clean the surface

There were a lot of assets provided which gave me the impression that multiple scenes needed to be created, however, due to the mediocre performance of the software and as well as the timeframe I decided to just stick with one. Again, with this one many assets were not provided so I just added them from my end which I thought worked best with the effect.
